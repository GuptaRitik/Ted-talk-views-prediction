<h1 align="center"> Ted Talk Views Prediction </h1>
<h3 align="center"><a href="https://certificates.almabetter.com/en/verify/03349039724348"> AlmaBetter Verified Project </a> </h5>

This project aims to predict the number of views for TED talks based on various features such as speaker, topic, duration, transcript, etc. The project uses machine learning techniques such as linear regression, random forest, and neural networks to build and evaluate different models. The project also explores the factors that influence the popularity and impact of TED talks. This can help TED organizers and speakers to optimize their content and delivery, as well as to identify the most engaging and influential topics for their audience. It can also help the viewers to discover and enjoy the most interesting and inspiring talks that suit their interests and needs.

<h2> :book: Extreme Gradient Boost</h2>

<p>Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) is a powerful and efficient framework for implementing gradient boosting algorithms. It builds an ensemble of weak learners, typically decision trees, that are sequentially fitted to the residuals of the previous learners. XGBoost uses a novel tree learning algorithm that handles sparsity, missing values, and regularization. It also supports parallel and distributed computing, as well as various objective functions and evaluation metrics.
