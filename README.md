TED is devoted to spreading powerful ideas on just about any topic. These datasets contain over 4,000 TED talks including transcripts in many languages. Founded in 1984 by Richard Salman as a nonprofit organization that aimed at bringing experts from the fields of Technology, Entertainment, and Design together, TED Conferences have gone on to become the Mecca of ideas from virtually all walks of life. As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan, and Bill Gates. The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help in predicting the views of the videos uploaded on the TEDx website.

This is the Regression problem as we need to predict Views (continous values), and there are various algorithm available which we are trying to model and choose the optimal model.

Goal:-
Analysing the data, providing insights and build a predictive ML model to predict the views for any given data of videos.

# Process towards Goal:-
* Importing necessary libraries (for Model building we're gonna  use scikit-learn)
* Importing dataset
* Data processing for EDA
* Exploratory data analysis
* Deriving insights and short conclusions
* Data Cleaning/Null value/missing value treatment 
* Feature engineering
* Data preprocessing
* Model building
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Comparision and selection of model
* conclusion
